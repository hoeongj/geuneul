# Geuneul — Summer Survival Map

[한국어](./README.md)

> A map service for finding nearby shelters and essential amenities during heat waves or rain. It searches more than 150,000 public-data locations with PostGIS and shows their current condition through a report-aware `survival_score`.

## Screenshots

### Map search and place discovery

<a href="https://geuneul.vercel.app"><img src="./docs/media/demo-desktop-3pane.png" alt="Desktop web: three-pane layout with search, nearby places, and map" /></a>

Search for nearby shelters, public toilets, and cafés while comparing the list and map markers.

### Shade-aware routes and place details

Check a place's condition, amenities, and recent reports, then find a route with a cooling-shelter or public-toilet waypoint.

### Mobile PWA

</p>

On mobile, the map and bottom sheet support nearby discovery, while scenario recommendations help users choose a place quickly. The service works in a browser and can also be installed as a PWA or Android app. More screens are in the [architecture document](./docs/architecture.md#데모).

## Design highlights

- Spatial queries stay in the database. Radius search uses `ST_DWithin`, nearest-neighbor search uses kNN `<->`, and viewport search uses GiST indexes. `EXPLAIN` verified index use, while k6 tuning reduced radius-search p95 from 2.68s to about 1.4s. The measured bottleneck was CPU rather than GiST ([ADR-0012](./docs/adr/0012-k6-load-explain-index-tuning.md)).
- Idempotent ETL and geocoding use the `source + source_external_id` natural key, so a batch can be run again without duplicates. The service stores 60,297 cooling shelters, 52,334 public toilets, 3,551 libraries, and commercial café/study-space data. Missing WGS84 coordinates are completed with Kakao geocoding and cached to avoid repeated requests.
- Real-time, geo-temporal UGC scoring combines expiring reports and durable reviews with trust weighting in `survival_score`. Report surges flow from PostgreSQL `LISTEN/NOTIFY` through multi-instance fan-out to SSE. Saved-place notifications use `INSERT … RETURNING` to send exactly once ([ADR-0016](./docs/adr/0016-realtime-report-surge-listen-notify-sse.md), [ADR-0026](./docs/adr/0026-bookmark-status-change-notification.md)).

## Using the service

- Web: the same URL supports desktop and mobile browsers. Desktop uses a map-and-list layout; mobile centers on the map and bottom sheet.
- Installation: the application is a PWA using a service worker and Web App Manifest. Android supports browser installation and a [signed APK](https://geuneul.vercel.app/geuneul.apk); iOS supports Add to Home Screen.
- Implementation: the web and installed app share the same Next.js client and BFF. Only responsive UI, service worker behavior, and the TWA package vary by environment.

## Architecture

![Architecture diagram](./docs/media/architecture.svg)

The browser calls only a same-origin `/api/*` server proxy (BFF). This avoids the ALB HTTP and CORS constraints. Spatial search and geo-temporal aggregation run through GiST indexes and SQL views in the database ([ADR-0004](./docs/adr/0004-frontend-same-origin-proxy.md)).

For runtime, ETL, CI/CD diagrams, and more screenshots, see [docs/architecture.md](./docs/architecture.md). AWS, OIDC, and Terraform deployment instructions are in [DEPLOY.md](./DEPLOY.md).

## `survival_score`

`survival_score` expresses the current condition of a place as a score from 0 to 100 and one of three marker states: green (good), yellow (fair), or gray (insufficient information).

```
survival_score = 0.25·distance + 0.20·comfort + 0.20·freshness − 0.15·risk   (+ open_now when data is available)
freshness: 0–1h=1.0 | 1–3h=0.8 | today=0.6 | this week=0.3 | older=0.1
```

- The SQL view `place_report_signals` performs geo-temporal aggregation. A pure Java function assembles weights and marker state, keeping heavy aggregation in the database and policy tuning testable ([ADR-0007](./docs/adr/0007-survival-score-sql-signals-java-compose.md)).
- Reports are trust-weighted and expire by type. Reviews remain as durable reputation data and are scored separately.
- Missing components such as `open_now` are not fabricated; weights are renormalized until the source data becomes available.
- Scenario recommendations reuse the same function with scenario-specific weights ([ADR-0008](./docs/adr/0008-recommendations-scenario-weighted-ranking.md)).

## Data and ETL

Public standard datasets are loaded idempotently: repeating the same source performs an upsert on `source + source_external_id`, and records absent from a new snapshot are soft-deactivated. Since public-toilet data stopped providing WGS84 coordinates after February 2025, the ingestion flow converts addresses to coordinates with the Kakao Local API and saves results for idempotency and rate-limit safety. See [the ETL flow](./docs/architecture.md#데이터--etl).

| Data | Refresh policy |
|---|---|
| Libraries | Automatic. EventBridge runs a full API ingestion and soft-delete sync on the 2nd of each month at 04:00 KST. |
| Weather | Automatic on demand. Data is refreshed after the 30-minute Redis TTL expires. |
| User reports | Immediate on submission; surges are delivered by SSE. |
| Cooling shelters and public toilets | Manual. Publish a new CSV snapshot, then run the ECS ingestion task. |
| Cafés and study cafés | Manual after confirming source availability and collection scope. |

## Quick start

```bash
# 1) Infrastructure — PostGIS + Redis
docker compose up -d

# 2) Backend — http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html
cd backend && ./gradlew bootRun

# 3) Frontend — http://localhost:3000
# Without a Kakao JavaScript key, the map is a placeholder but API data still works.
cd frontend && pnpm install && pnpm dev
```

Public-data ingestion is idempotent and safe to rerun:

```bash
cd backend
./gradlew bootRun --args='--ingest.source=cooling_shelter --ingest.file=/path/to/cooling-shelters.csv --ingest.charset=MS949'
```
